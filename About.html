        Hello! My name is Uday Albataineh, and I'm a Computer Scientest based in Houston, Texas. With a strong background in Python, Java, and light C++, I am passionate about creating Software that makes a positive impact on people's lives.

Throughout my career, I have had the opportunity to work on various projects related to marketing and game design. Some of my notable achievements include creating a chess game and being part of the team at a marketing start-up. I am persuing a degree in computer science from The University of Houston.

My goals include Mastering data structures and algorithms and Specializing in a subfield, and I am always looking for opportunities to collaborate with like-minded professionals and organizations. By sharing my portfolio and resume, I hope to connect with potential partners, employers, and clients who share my vision and values.

In my free time, I enjoy electronics and hardware tinkering, Gaming, and Puzzles and logic games, which inspire me to stay creative and curious. Feel free to explore my portfolio to learn more about my work, and don't hesitate to get in touch if you'd like to discuss potential collaborations or job opportunities. Thank you for stopping by!
